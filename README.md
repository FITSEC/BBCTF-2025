# BBCTF-2025
Challenge repo for BBCTF 2025

## Things To Know and Do:
- In the the README.md of the challenge directory, list
  - Challenge title as the header
  - Estimated difficulty (easy, medium, hard)
  - Challenge prompt that will go up on CTFd
  - Filenames of files shared to be shared on the CTFd (or `Files: none` if there aren't any to be shared)
- Create a directory called `solution` with:
  - `writeup.md` that details the solution
  - A solve script if the challenge can be solved via script 
- If it requires a remote service, please make it a docker container
- The flag format is `bbctf{...}`
- Please try to get your challenges done by the end of the month. I understand that's pretty soon to pump out challenges and that's my fault, so if it comes in later I understand. If you need help with a chall just reach out to me and I'd be more than willing to help you out
