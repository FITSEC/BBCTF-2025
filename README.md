# BBCTF-2025
## Challenge repo for BBCTF 2025
This was an internal CTF that we held for our members. It was meant to
be a good introductory CTF for people to get their feet wet with CTFing
and hopefully convince people that yeah CTFing is awesome and more flags
must be captured. The goal was to push out challenges ranging from very
beginner friendly at the easiest all the way up to a legitimate easy
or moderate challenge are the hardest. If you're looking for training
material for beginners, I hope this brings some good use to you!
