# BBCTF-2025
Challenge repo for BBCTF 2025

## Things To Know and Do:
- Make sure you make a writeup, make it the README.md of the challenge directory
  - Besides the solution, make sure you list the challenge title, prompt, and estimated difficulty (easy, medium, hard)
- If it requires a remote service, please make it a docker container.
- The flag format is `fitsec{...}`
- Please try to get your challenges done by the end of the month. I understand that's pretty soon to pump out challenges and that's my fault, so if it comes in later I understand. If you need help with a chall just reach out to me and I'd be more than willing to help you out.
