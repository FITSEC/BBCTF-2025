#BBrain Fart
Hard

Whoa, I found this memory dump from the future! Apparently the creator wanted to distribute an Awesome Secretâ„¢ with it, but no one ever got the Awesome Secretâ„¢ with it :(. Maybe you could solve it for him and make him happy? Perhaps this Awesome Secretâ„¢ will show us the way out from BB's thumb too...

*The flag format is* `fitsec{...}` *because yes, this is the exact same challenge as the one up on the internal CTF...* ðŸ˜„
