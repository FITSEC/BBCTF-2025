# Solution
In short, use volatility's `linux.proc.Maps --pid 1798 --dump` after identifying the suspicious pid with `vol -f cheeseless.dmp linux.pslist.PsList` (I'd argue the process name of "print_my_thing" is pretty suspiscios lol). From the files dumped with `Maps`, the actual elf would be in `pid.1798.vma.0x400000-0x401000.dmp`. So now it's just reverse engineering the flag printer to ultimately get the flag! Note that this actually (uinintentionally, I might add) ended up being a more difficult RE challenge because Binary Ninja and Ghidra (the only two decompilers I use) both CANNOT for the life of them show you that the swap list is just stored in a double list. I advise using a decompiler and comparing it to the source file to try and get used to identifying something like this!
